An Ewe language learning web app written in Python.


The Ewe language is a minority global language, with a relatively small native speaking population and it is largely used for personal and social situations. My app will provide a  interactive experience for Anglophone users to learn Ewe, similar to the Duolingo course tracks.

I'm most familiar and experienced with Python so that is the program language of choice on this project. I will use the Django framework for web programming. Another alternative is Flask.


The app is made up of 4 modules: UI, logic, quiz and user stats.


All of this may change as I learn more on this project. The decisions I've made are educated guesses, this is my first app.
