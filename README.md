# Ewe Tones: A Web App

An (unfinished) Ewe language learning web app written in Python Flask, used to teach myself some web programming back in 2018. I'm going over it again to update and extend it.

The Ewe language is a minority global language, with a relatively small native speaking population and it is largely used for personal and social situations. As a tonal language, a vital part of practice is to reproduce tones coherently. The website will host a tool that compares and contrasts the speaker's tones with native samples.
