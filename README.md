# Learning Ewe: A Web App

An (unfinished) Ewe language learning web app written in Python Flask, used to teach myself some web programming back in 2018. I'm going over it again to update and complete it.


The Ewe language is a minority global language, with a relatively small native speaking population and it is largely used for personal and social situations. My app will provide a  interactive experience for Anglophone users to learn Ewe, similar to the Duolingo course tracks.

The app was initially made up of 4 modules: UI, logic, quiz and user stats.
